<h2>Welcome to OpenIndiana Hipster!</h2>

<p>OpenIndiana is an illumos based Unix distribution derived from OpenSolaris.
Engineered as a general-purpose operating system with enterprise-class features,
OpenIndiana Hipster is developed by the community, and for the community.</p>

<p>OpenIndiana obtains its name from Project Indiana, an open source effort
by Sun Microsystems (now Oracle Corporation) to produce OpenSolaris, a community
developed Unix distribution based on Sun Solaris. Project Indiana was led by
Ian Murdock, founder of the Debian Linux distribution.</p>

<p>Some of the differences between OpenIndiana and OpenSolaris can be characterized as follows:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Sun's OS/NET consolidation (closed by Oracle) has been replaced with
    <a href="https://github.com/illumos/illumos-gate">illumos-gate</a>.</li><br>
  <li>Many of the original OpenSolaris software consolidations have been reorganized
    into a single <a href="https://github.com/OpenIndiana/oi-userland">oi-userland consolidation</a>.</li><br>
  <li>Oracle's Sun Studio has been replaced with the open source <a href="https://github.com/illumos/gcc">GNU GCC compiler</a>.</li><br>
  <li>XVM (Xen) has been replaced with the <a href="https://github.com/joyent/illumos-kvm">illumos KVM port</a>.</li><br>
</ul>

<h2>Why OpenIndiana and illumos?</h2>

<p>In contrast to Linux, illumos is developed as a whole operating system
with tight coupling between kernel and userspace tools, therefore technologies
are very well integrated with each other:</p>

<ul>
  <li>When operating system is updated by the IPS package management system,
    ZFS features like Boot Environment and snapshots are leveraged in every
    respect of the process.</li><br>
  <li>When Global Zone is updated, IPS makes sure, that packages
    in Zones are updated as well, or, at minimum, are kept in a coherent state.</li><br>
  <li>System utilities like <tt>pgrep</tt>, <tt>pkill</tt>, <tt>ps</tt>, <tt>ptree</tt>, <tt>svcprop</tt>,
    and <tt>ipmon</tt> have <tt>-z</tt> option, which enables them to operate on a particular Zone without the need
    to login to the Zone first.</li><br>
  <li>The Crossbow network virtualization framework and Role-Based Access Control
    (RBAC) model frameworks are also very well integrated with the rest of the system.</li><br>
  <li>Locality Groups (NUMA affinity) have been provided by the core operating system
    for many years, contrasting with other systems' reliance on "third-party" libraries.</li>
</ul>

<p>illumos offers features that have equivalents (Zones are inspired from FreeBSD Jails,
KVM is ported from Linux), successors (eBPF dynamic tracing), or have been replicated on
other systems (DTrace, ZFS, Zones, kernel scheduler, slab allocator).</p>

<p>Considering the cross-pollination of technologies with FreeBSD and Linux, our code-base
had contributed in a notable extent to operating system's innovation. Hence we still strive
for relevance, observability, and consistency!</p>
